Glad I have these to watch when I can't watch TV.\\n\",\n '__label__1 Intellectual Redundancy: When an author clearly aspires to be looked upon by the public eye as an \"intellectual\" and seeks to impress others with his extreem wordiness, redundancy of expressions and use of technical terms, he writes not for the benefit of all who will read his work but he writes to benefit his \"intellectual\" ego. Other than this obvious impression, the work is adequate enough for the subject.I was able to purchase this book for just over $5.00 and am not sure I paid too much.\\n',\n \"__label__1 Nonsense: This movie doesn't make a lot of sense. The motivation of the principal actor remains completely unclear up to the very end of the movie. In addition, he looks more like a US Marine than a Native American. The only notable performances come from Adam Beach and the congenial Raul Trujillo. Trujillo would deserve to get better roles!\\n\",\n '__label__2 Deep Deep: This is a nice deep house production. If you like this, check out the first full length CD for producer Quentin Allen as Karu. There are other 12\" releases on Silver Network, Dadhouse, Winding Road, Mimosa & Smooth Agent. This CD is a very consistant production with a good blend of jazz, hip-hop, techno, neo-soul, and deep house all together. The beats are very crisp and sound good in the car, the house or the club. Some songs tastefully use vocal snippets to add flavor. There is even a track featuring Warren Harris aka Hanna (Shadow Records, Silver Network, Flat & Round, Freerange). If you want good quality deep house, this CD is for you.\\n',\n '__label__2 Perfect, exactly what I needed!: It is what it is. 25 pieces individually bagged in the box. I use them for mounting J-Hooks onto beams. Also used one for a custom small camera mount. They are handy.\\n',\n \"__label__1 Will never buy anything from Kodak every again: I purchased this camera on June 17, 2006. It worked great at first with a big LCD screen and with a memory card I could take what seemed like an unlimited amount of pictures and videos.However in January when in Disney World, all of a sudden the screen had blue lines across it in every which way and half the screen was black. I called Kodak and explained that I did nothing to the camera to cause this, and they fixed it for me.And then yesterday the exact same thing happened, again, while I was on vacation. And since it was one week over a year old, the warranty is void and I'm basically screwed, and now I'm wasting my entire day off from work looking for a new one.In addition, the quality of the pictures even at the highest quality is horrible, as they are blurry and look smeared.I will never buy another Kodak as long as I live.\\n\",\n \"__label__1 waste of money: The Panic Mouse is such a let down.These wands don't really connect to the unit, so they just yank out with enough force. And my 10 month old cat had enough force to do it! What a bad design.\\n\",\n \"__label__1 Blah w/ a couple laughs: I read the Girl's Guide and loved it. I expected something good from Bank. I read it in a couple of days. I was disappointed, esp the ending. She has a few good insights and that's about it.\\n\",\n '__label__1 Blender problem: I purchased this blender because Consumer Reports rated it the best for making smoothies and ice drinks. Three weeks after I got it, some of the plastic teeth on the bottom of the blade mechanism broke off. It still worked, but I am sure the rest would break off soon. I returned the blender and will look for one with no plastic parts on the important operating mechanisms.\\n',\n \"__label__2 A Fantastic 3d DVD: There aren't many 3d videos or dvds around, this one is the pick of the crop. It is easily the best 3d movie ever made, one of the few that didn't trivialise the depth effects and eeriness of 3d, but used to enhance an otherwise enthralling film. Technologically, no other 3d movie was ever so seamlessly and flawlessly made. Without the 3d however, this is still a great film, it has such a great creepy, mysterious feeling, and a deliberately paced build-up and denouement. This is more than worth the modest price!\\n\"]"
